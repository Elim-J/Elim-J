# Hi, I’m @Elim-J 

- 👀 I’m interested in Frontend programming, React, JS, HTML/CSS and coffee ☕
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React to build my own personal projects
- 🎯 My goal on Github is to contribute everyday so that my graph is green!
- 🤓 I'm always ready to learn anything, but this year, I want to be completely focused on coding
